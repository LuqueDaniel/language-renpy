Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Ren'Py files in Atom.

Originally converted from the [Python package for Atom](https://github.com/atom/language-python).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.

* The highlight may vary depending on the syntax theme used.
* Standard theme indicated: Atom Dark.
* To have better functionality is advisable to ~~install~~ (the following plugins are now included in the Atom >1.0) the plugins `autocomplete-plus` and `autocomplete-snippets`.
* Other recommended plugin (just for styling): `file-icons`.

>Ren'Py is a Visual Novel development tool, available from [www.renpy.org](http://www.renpy.org/)

>Thanks to [Koroshiya](https://github.com/koroshiya) (Sublime-Renpy) and [PyTom](https://github.com/renpytom) (Ren'Py), of course!

## Getting Started

### Installation

With [Atom](https://atom.io/) already installed, open the Settings tab: `File`>`Settings` (or with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd>)

Click in <kbd>+ Install</kbd> and search for `renpy` then click in <kbd>Install</kbd> button of the package `language-renpy`.

It's also possible installing using the cmd command `apm` (atom package manager):
```sh
apm install language-renpy
```

### Usage

Open a `.rpy` file or create a new one and test the syntax highlighting of the Ren'Py. Also use the [example file](https://github.com/williamd1k0/language-renpy/blob/master/example.rpy) available on the package repository.

Snippets:

Snippets are pieces of code like in the following example.

The usage is done with keywords followed by a <kbd>Tab</kbd> to insert the snippet.

For example, there's a snippet with useful links, type `dochelp` and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

You can check the snippets list with Atom, being at the tab of a `.rpy` file and pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> or going to the package settings (`Settings`>`Packages`>`language-renpy`>`Snippets`).

Snippets are added by need, so suggestions are welcomed. Use the [repository issue](https://github.com/williamd1k0/language-renpy/issues/6) to leave your suggestion or send a message to `tumeowilliam@gmail.com`.
