Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Ren'Py files in Atom.

Originally converted from the [Python package for Atom](https://github.com/atom/language-python).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.

* The highlight may vary depending on the syntax theme used.
* Standard theme indicated: Atom Dark.
* To have better functionality is advisable to ~~install~~(The following plugins are now included in the Atom >1.0) the plugins `autocomplete-plus` and `autocomplete-snippets`.
* Other recommended plugin (just for styling): `file-icons`.

>Still under development.
