# Ren'Py language support in Atom  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/williamd1k0/language-renpy.svg?branch=patch-1)](https://travis-ci.org/williamd1k0/language-renpy)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Ren'Py files in Atom.

Originally converted from the [Python package for Atom](https://github.com/atom/language-python).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.

* The highlight may vary depending on the syntax theme used.
* Standard theme indicated: Atom Dark.
* To have better functionality is advisable to install the plugin `autocomplete-plus` and `autocomplete-snippets`(snippets for Ren'Py under development).
* Other recommended plugin (just for styling): `file-icons`.

>Still under development.

>Update 1.1.0: Indent function and a few reserved words added.

>Update 1.2.0: More indent and reserved words added and deleting unnecessary code.

>Update 1.3.0: Added several keywords and classes; Added dollar-sign ($); Added more indent keywords; and code optimization.

>To-do: Add more words, add snippets, optimize code and create a Getting Started doc.

>Thanks to [Koroshiya](https://github.com/koroshiya) and [PyTom](https://github.com/renpytom), of course!
